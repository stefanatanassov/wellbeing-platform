<h1>Integration Intent & Scope</h1>
<p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 1 February 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This platform is a <strong>trainer-first decision-support system</strong> designed to help
professional coaches scale personalized training using Garmin data.
</p>
<p>
The platform provides longitudinal visibility into athlete training and recovery trends,
supported by <strong>AI-assisted summaries</strong>, while <strong>all training execution remains on Garmin
devices and within Garmin Connect</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The platform does not replace trainers, provide medical advice, or automate coaching decisions.
It is intended to support professional judgment, not override it.
</p>

<h2>Primary Users</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary users:</strong> Professional trainers and coaches</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary participants:</strong> Athletes, by trainer invitation only</li>
  <li>Athletes must explicitly authorize access to their Garmin data</li>
  <li>Athletes are not charged directly by the platform</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Access & Scope</h2>
<p><strong>Accessed (summary-level, historical data only):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Activity summaries (type, duration, intensity indicators)</li>
  <li>Training load or equivalent workload proxies</li>
  <li>Sleep duration and high-level sleep quality indicators</li>
  <li>Rest versus training day patterns</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Explicitly excluded (initial version):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Raw GPS routes</li>
  <li>Second-by-second heart rate data</li>
  <li>Real-time monitoring or alerts</li>
</ul>

<p>
This scope is intentionally limited to support <strong>trend and pattern analysis</strong>, not
live intervention.
</p>

<h2>Use of AI</h2>
<p>
AI is used strictly for <strong>trainer decision support</strong>. Specifically, AI is used to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Summarize trends across weeks and months</li>
  <li>Highlight correlations between training load, recovery, and consistency</li>
  <li>Flag potential overreaching or under-recovery patterns</li>
  <li>Surface considerations for trainer review</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI does not:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Prescribe workouts</li>
  <li>Override trainer decisions</li>
  <li>Provide health or medical advice</li>
  <li>Act as an autonomous coach</li>
</ul>

<p>
All training decisions remain the responsibility of the trainer.
</p>

<h2>Training Execution</h2>
<p>
Training plans are created and adjusted by trainers. Training execution occurs entirely
on <strong>Garmin devices and within Garmin Connect</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The platform does not attempt to replace Garmin’s training creation or execution experience.
It supports trainers in managing and evaluating training delivered through Garmin’s ecosystem.
</p>

<h2>Consent, Privacy & Data Handling</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Athlete data is accessed only after explicit user authorization via Garmin’s official mechanisms</li>
  <li>Trainers cannot access athlete data without athlete consent</li>
  <li>Athletes may revoke access or request data deletion at any time</li>
  <li>Only summary-level data required for platform functionality is retained</li>
  <li>Personal data is not sold or shared with third parties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Medical & Regulatory Position</h2>
<p>
The platform is <strong>non-medical</strong> and <strong>non-diagnostic</strong>. It provides informational summaries
to support professional training decisions and is not positioned as a healthcare product.
</p>

<h2>Monetization</h2>
<p>
The platform is monetized via <strong>trainer subscriptions</strong>. Trainers bundle the cost into their
own services. Athletes are not charged directly by the platform.
</p>

<h2>Garmin Alignment & Long-Term Vision</h2>
<p>
Garmin devices are required to ensure data consistency and training execution.
The platform is <strong>Garmin-first by design</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Longer-term goals include supporting professional adoption of Garmin devices and helping
trainers recommend appropriate Garmin products based on athlete needs.
