<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 1 February 2026</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how personal data is collected, used, and protected
when using this platform and related services.
</p>

<h2>1. Scope of the Platform</h2>
<p>
The platform is designed for use by professional trainers and coaches to support
training analysis and planning. Athletes participate only by invitation from a
trainer and must explicitly authorize access to their data.
</p>
<p>
The platform provides informational summaries and insights to support professional
training decisions. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or automated
coaching.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
Personal data is collected only after explicit user authorization through
Garmin’s official authorization mechanisms (Garmin Connect APIs).
</p>
<p>
Collected data may include summary-level historical information such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activity summaries (type, duration, intensity indicators)</li>
  <li>Training load or workload proxies</li>
  <li>Sleep duration and high-level sleep quality indicators</li>
  <li>Rest versus training day patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>
The platform intentionally does not collect raw GPS routes, second-by-second
heart rate data, or real-time monitoring data.
</p>

<h2>3. Purpose of Data Use</h2>
<p>
Data is used solely to provide trainers with longitudinal insights, trend analysis,
and AI-assisted summaries to support training planning and evaluation.
</p>
<p>
Personal data is not used for advertising and is not sold to third parties.
</p>

<h2>4. Use of AI</h2>
<p>
AI features are used exclusively to summarize historical patterns, highlight trends,
and surface considerations for trainer review. AI does not prescribe workouts,
override trainer decisions, or provide health or medical advice.
</p>

<h2>5. Data Access & Sharing</h2>
<p>
Trainer access to athlete data is permitted only after explicit athlete consent.
Athletes may revoke access at any time.
</p>
<p>
Personal data is not shared with third parties, except where required to operate
core platform functionality or to comply with legal obligations.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Storage & Security</h2>
<p>
Data is stored securely using reasonable technical and organizational measures
designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss.
Access is restricted to systems necessary for platform operation.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
<p>
Personal data is retained only for as long as necessary to provide platform
functionality. Athletes may request deletion of their data at any time.
</p>

<h2>8. User Rights</h2>
<p>
Users have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of their
personal data. Requests can be made using the contact information below.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be published
on this page with an updated revision date.
